# photon-threshold-ML
The minimum photon number that makes the sensation of seeing has been
investigated in the previous decades [1], [3], [4], [2]. The common method for
determining the minimum photon threshold number is doing experiments on
human subjects by sending their cornea a series of light flashes. After that,
the subjects are asked if they had any sensation of light or not. Answer of
this question is typically yes/no [1], [3]. Hecth et al showed that human are
able to see with the existence of minimum number of 5 âˆ’ 7 photons.
The basic approach for determining the photon threshold number Hecth
et al is explained in the proceeding paragraphs.
