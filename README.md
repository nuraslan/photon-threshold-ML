# photon-threshold-ML
Machine learning model for experiments determining minimum number of photons detected by human retina when it is exposed to 
Poisson light in dark room conditions.

Logistic Regression is a good fit for Poisson statistics of photons in this model.

This code models the results of experiments discussed in the following paper:
